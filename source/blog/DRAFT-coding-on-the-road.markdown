title: Coding on the Road
---

For the past four months I've been a digital nomad, traveling and working remotely from wherever I am. As a programmer, I'm blessed to do work that largely doesn't require a physical presence and for which bits traveling wirelessly earn me an income. Though most folks claim it's an incredible time to be a programmer from a career-prospect perspective, I value the freedom/flexibility perspective far more. I set out to take advantage of that freedom at the end of May, and haven't looked back.

But, it's not all fun and games. Working on the road and in airports/airplanes comes with a host of challenges relative to your daily routine at home. Here's some issues I've run into and tips on how to be productive working while traveling:

## Unreliable Public WiFi

Can you imagine if the reliability of lights in a building were that of the wifi in the same building? As much as I feel we are "living in the future", I'm incredibly frustrated over the poor state of wifi quality - whether paid or free. If someome advertises and offers "high-speed wifi", I think there's a reasonable expectation to have at least consistent latency below 150ms and speed of 1mbps down. Many places don't even come close to this. It's an information assymmetry problem, because newcomers to a venue see the advertisement for free wifi (bundling with paid goods even if it's "free" at the margin), make purchasing decisions with this in mind, and incur a high degree of uncertainty whether it will work out.

Tip: Have a speedtest application on your phone, and check wifi quality *before* entering the venue and committing to buy something. This doesn't guarentee you're going to have a productive session, but you can at least weed our attrociously bad wifi beforehand.

Tip: Always have a back-up LTE tether. I can't stress how important and freeing this is to always have a backup - pretty much no matter where I am, I can tether to my phone and at least get *something* done, even if it's bandwidth-limited.

## Coworking Drop-ins & Day Rates

Many coworking spaces will let you drop in for a day, sometimes for free, but if not usually for a small fee. This is a good alternative to public wifi venues like coffee shops, and increases your likelyhood of meeting new people and getting involved with the local community. The wifi issue above is also rarely an issue in coworking spots.

## Commit to a Productive Working Session

When traveling it's all-too easy to get distracted and want to go do things.

## Travel-plan during Leisure Time Only

Traveling nonstop means you'll spend a fair amount of time booking flights, finding hostels/hotels, and forming itineraries. It's easy to get drawn deeply into this and loose track of time. When you sit down to work, commit to work only - save travel planning for later at night or whenever your mind is less productive.

## Quiet Places for a Phone Call

Public places are noisy, and it can be difficult to find a place to just have a nice phone call.

Tip: If staying a hotel, get 4PM late checkout (comes with elite status on some hotel chains). This guarentees you a quiet place to come back to for a phone call if necessary.

Tip: Consider a coworking spot with phone booths. Not all of them have them, and they aren't great for long conversations, but it's often a great place to have a short call.

Tip: Make extensive use of selective muting. I've held many phone calls from noisy airports and coffee shops, and unless I'm the one doing most of the talking, being able to mute myself when I'm not talking gives for a more pleasant call all-around.

Tip: If all else fails, consider wide open spaces. I once held a phone call in the vast open space surrounding the Washington monument. Thankfully I was able to selectively mute myself whenever a plane landed at DCA.

## Working on Airplanes

I'm great at working on airplanes - I find them incredibly focus-inducing and lacking any sort of distraction. The constant hum substitutes well for the coffee-shop background noise I usually crave. 

Tip: Get a small laptop. I could not live without my MacBook air, which I feel comfortable working on in virtually any airplane seat.

Tip: Get a long-lasting battery. With my 12hr-battery MacBook Air, it's nice never having to worry about plugging in. I can have a fully productive day, then plug in overnight.

Tip: Consider airlines with wifi: Not all of them have it, but many do, and if you're going to be productive on a 6hr flight, paying $20 really isn't so bad (or, consider a monthly subscription if you fly a lot). That being said, my most productive sessions are usually on planes *without* wifi (no distractions!), so do realize this can be a double-edged sword.

## Working in Airports

With my mileage-running hobby, I spend a lot of time in airports.
